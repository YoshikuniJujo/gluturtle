To repair closeField, need my original nextEvent,
which type is IO (Maybe Event).
The bone is like follow.

myNextEvent = do
	c <- newChan
	forkIO $ do
		e <- nextEvent
		writeChan c $ Just e
	forkIO $ do
		c <- readChan closeChan
		writeChan c Nothing
	readChan c

I think I can repair closeField use this function.

To undo for clearLayer, each layer has history of cleared.
And if undo then history poped.

I'll make new module Layers.
Then operate Layer in the module.

Mmm, buffer of layer make problem complex.
