To repair closeField, need my original nextEvent,
which type is IO (Maybe Event).
The bone is like follow.

myNextEvent = do
	c <- newChan
	forkIO $ do
		e <- nextEvent
		writeChan c $ Just e
	forkIO $ do
		c <- readChan closeChan
		writeChan c Nothing
	readChan c

I think I can repair closeField use this function.
